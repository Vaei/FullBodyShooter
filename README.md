# Full Body Shooter
Third Person Template with Full Body IK that moves away from the Camera, allowing it to be used for First Person Shooter

For a first person shooter I use full-body IK on a third person body so it can't clip the camera. This is an example project built minimally on a third person template.

## Expansion
Not shown here, but I also tend to chop off the arms and add first person arms instead. The end result is first person with a third person body when you look down.

Made in Unreal Engine 5.0.3.

## Limitation

Does NOT support True First Person where the camera is attached to the head socket. You will need to get the information between where the result is computed and where it is applied which is well beyond the scope of this project and I won't be covering it elsewhere.
